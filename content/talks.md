## Machine Learning with Go

### Go Bristol April 2020

Machine Learning is often viewed as something akin to magic, only within the grasp of big companies like Facebook and Google who build machine learning models in Python using established frameworks like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow. So why on earth would you do this in Go? In this talk, James will try to dispel some of the myths and, with just a pinch of maths, build a basic ML model from scratch in Go.
