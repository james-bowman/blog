Hi, my name is James Bowman and I am the CTO at <a href="http://fresh8gaming.com/">Fresh8 Gaming</a>.  
</p>
<p>
I love coding in Go, microservices, continuous delivery and DevOps and have recently been learning lots about data science and machine learning both in Go and Julia. I am fascinated by coaching, learning, people's behaviour and organisational change.
</p>
<p>
I work in London/Bristol and live in Hartfield, East Sussex in the UK with my wife, Rachel and two children.
