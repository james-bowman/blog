Hi, my name is James Bowman and I am currently the Chief Architect at <a href="http://www.markelinternational.com/">Markel International</a>.  
</p>
<p>
I love coding in Go, microservices, continuous delivery and DevOps. I am also fascinated by coaching, learning, people's behaviour and organisational change.
</p>
<p>
I work in London and live in Horsham, West Sussex in the UK with my wife, Rachel and two children.
