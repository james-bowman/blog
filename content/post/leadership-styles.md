Traditionally people used to think leadership was an inherent quality and that individuals have their own distinct leadership style.  Each style has its own strengths and weaknesses, situations where it excels and others where it is less effective.  Therefore, whilst it is natural to have a preferred style that one feels comfortable with, a good leader is able to adapt their style depending upon the situation or context, the team or individual being influenced and the task at hand.  This is called [Situational Leadership].

[Situational Leadership] is a theory of leadership and influencing developed by [Paul Hersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Hersey) and [Ken Blanchard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Blanchard).  The theory assumes that an individual or team's maturity is a progression from low to high.  When individuals approach a task or activity for the first time, they have very little knowledge or skill but these develop over time with education, practice and experience.  As an individual or team's maturity increases, they respond better to less directive influence and conversely, people with low maturity in a given task respond better to more directive influencing styles.  

The idea of maturity as an evolutionary progression is not an uncommon one and is central to [maturity models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maturity_model) and popular learning theory such as the [four stages of competence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence) and the [Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition][Dreyfus Model].  Like [Situational Leadership], the [Dreyfus Model] states that different influencing and teaching styles are more effective at different stages of maturity.  For example, 'Novices' (the lowest level of maturity in the [Dreyfus Model]) need clear rules and check-lists to follow whereas people who are 'Proficient' (a higher level of maturity) typically need practice and access to broader contexts.
