People used to think leadership was an inherent quality and that each person had their own distinct leadership style.  Each style has its own strengths and weaknesses, situations where it excels and others where it is less effective.  Therefore, whilst it is natural to have a preferred style that one feels comfortable with, a good leader is able to adapt their style depending upon the situation or context, the team being led and the task at hand.  This is called [Situational Leadership].
