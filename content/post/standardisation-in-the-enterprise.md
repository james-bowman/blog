+++

In enterprises there is often a strong desire to standardise.  This applies to software applications and business processes but also technologies and practices.  The reasoning is simple: if we are all doing something the same way, using the same technology, then we can simplify our operations, benefit from economies and make our people more fungible.  So by extension, not standardising means duplicated effort, resources and expenditure.  

Why then, given these clear benefits to standardising, do many people reject and rebel against standards?

Perhaps we can begin to understand the answer to this question by thinking about the meaning of the word standardisation.  Most Thesaurus' would say the opposite of the word standardisation is _deviation_.
 This is an interesting word conjouring up all sorts of negative conotations that could influence people's behaviour and drive entirely the wrong outcomes.

I would argue that more accurate words to describe the opposite of standardisation, in this context, are _diversification_ and _customisation_.  It turns out that there are many benefits to diversification and customisation:

- Lower risk - reduced exposure to a single key technology, application or supplier
- Increased responsiveness and agility - increased autonomy with fewer dependencies and lower impact of change
- Potentially increased productivity and/or revenue - customisation of experience, application, practices and processes to best suit territories, teams and customers involved

So it seems that both approaches (standardisation and customisation/diversification) have their own, albeit different, benefits.

Standards are mainly about optimising the bottom line (cost savings and efficiencies) where as diversification and customisation can improve the top line (revenue), whilst potentially increasing costs to achieve it.  This is of course an extremely simplified view because customisation and diversification can potentially lower costs too - lower cost of change, more productive staff, lower cost incurred by each product or vendor (e.g. upgrades), etc.  It is just these costs are not as obvious and may never be realised while in the meantime, the cost of the duplicated resources required to support the diversification/customisation is adding up.




 and that the choice of approach should be made based upon the benefits most aligned to desired outcome.  Furthermore, the choice of approach should be made on a case by case basis i.e. an organisation might wish to standardise their general HR system but diversify payroll due to regional variations e.g. taxes, currency, bank transfers, etc.

This is further promoted by the idea that the reason people do not like adopting standards is that they do not like change.  They are simply ludites, clinging to their existing way of working and resisting the new order.  After a period of adjustment, they will be productive again using the new standard.  Whilst there may be an element of truth in this, I think the truth is rather more complicated.

Believe it or not, standardisation is not just a technology problem.  It is pointless standardising on a single application if that application is still expected to continue supporting the same divergent business processes.
