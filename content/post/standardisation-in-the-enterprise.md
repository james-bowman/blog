+++

In enterprises there is often a strong desire to standardise.  The reasoning is simple: if we are all doing things the same way, using the same technology, then we can simplify our operations, benefit from economies and make our people more fungible.  So by extension, not standardising means duplicated effort, resources and expenditure.  But are things really this clear cut?

Perhaps we should begin by thinking about the meaning of the word standardisation and understanding the alternatives.  Wikipedia defines [standardisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization) as:

	Standardization or standardisation is the process of implementing and developing technical standards. Standardization can help to maximize compatibility, interoperability, safety, repeatability, or quality. It can also facilitate commoditization of formerly custom processes.  

Interestingly, there is no mention of _uniformity_ in this definition even though the two terms are frequently used interchangeably in many enterprises.  Many people believe standards are about consolidating on uniform, and usually centralised, solutions.




Most Thesaurus' would say the opposite of the word standardisation is _deviation_ which would imply that people who do not adhere to standards are _deviants_.  This conjours up all sorts of negative conotations that could influence people's behaviour and drive entirely the wrong outcomes.

I would argue that more accurate words to describe the opposite of standardisation, in this context, are _diversification_ and _customisation_.  And it turns out there are many benefits to diversification and customisation:

- **Lower risk** - reduced exposure to a single key technology, application or supplier
- **Increased responsiveness and agility** - increased autonomy with fewer dependencies and lower impact of change
- **Potentially increased productivity and/or revenue** - customisation of experience, application, practices and processes to best suit territories, teams and customers involved

## Standardisation vs Customisation/Diversification

So it seems that both approaches (standardisation and customisation/diversification) have their own, albeit different, sets of benefits.  Standardisation is often bourne out of attempts to optimise the bottom line (costs) where as diversification and customisation tend to come about when optimising the top line (revenue).  

Of course in reality, things are much more complicated.  Trying to reduce costs through standardisation often simply pushes the costs elsewhere.  For example, standardising and centralising all workflow in a single, shared workflow system with a dedicated team may result in economies (reduced workflow licencing and staff costs across the enterprise).  However, the team looking after the workflow system, will probably become a bottleneck for all workflow related changes across the enterprise, resulting in increased lead times for each change.  Furthermore, the more applications using the shared system (and the greater the apparent economies), the harder the shared system will be to change in the future.  Clearly, in our increasingly competitive market environments, where businesses are trying to accelerate the development and rollout of new products and services, such costs and delays will cause problems and potentially missed opportunities.



So how do we accelerate the business, improving time to market and still reduce costs?

Understand Conways law
Separate business units will have separate systems.  Every system will have a team and the flows of communication between the systems will mirror that between the teams.  Put simply, the architecture will mirror the organisational structure and attempts to fight this will end in failure.  If you standardise 5 discreet software applications into one but continue to support the 5 discreet business processes failure will ensue.  The standardised application will have to maintain the complexity of supporting all the divergent business processes either explicitly through complex conditional logic or by generalising to the point of obscurity.




What are standard.

Principles/constraints around things to promote interoperability, compatibility, security, quality, usability, etc.  Especially where things must interoperate with other things or we need to treat things the same from the outside e.g. platforms, tooling, user/customer experience, company brand, etc.

Centralisation/consolidation - commoditisation vs customisation



Standardised Services
- Standardise applications or resources as services that should be commodity and can be easily generalised with little or no customisation e.g. infrastructure, document management and turn them into a PaaS with a clearly defined set of constraints allowing users to self-serve.
- focus on core strength - avoid temptation to build too much flexibility into standardised solutions. 
- Push variation out of standardised platform
- Standardise principles/interfaces/taxonomy that things should exhibit/constraints to run on/in standardised service
- If not standardising the thing itself standardise the language we use to define the thing and let the things vary.

- Make self service as much as possible to avoid handoffs with central teams
- Align organisation structure with systems architecture

Emergent behaviour - if technology should be reused, it will be if the organisation has been setup correctly.

Conways law - teams and systems

fewer handoffs.







It is clear that adopting either strategy across the board does not represent a reasonable response and the choice of approach should be made on a case-by-case basis depending upon the desired outcomes.




Standardisation is often considered an IT problem but [Conway's Law]() would suggest that it is really an organisational problem.






Each case should be considered carefully on an individual basis and the appropriate strategy selected depending upon the desired outcome(s).

 and that the choice of approach should be made based upon the benefits most aligned to desired outcome.  Furthermore, the choice of approach should be made on a case by case basis i.e. an organisation might wish to standardise their general HR system but diversify payroll due to regional variations e.g. taxes, currency, bank transfers, etc.

In reality, neither across-the-board (complete) standardisation nor total adaptation represent reasonable business responses. Goals of reducing costs and complexity lead firms to consider standardisation,while a customer orientation sways them toward product adaptation


"One size fits all"

global enterprise: standardisation
local differentiation: customisation

best combination of global and local activities for competitive advantage

Think globally, act locally



1. Standardise technology
2. Standardise application/installation/implementation
3. Standardise business process
4. Standardise user experience
5. Standardise taxonomy
6. Standardise framework

	standardised/extension

	organisational design = architecture
Believe it or not, standardisation is not just a technology problem.  It is pointless standardising on a single application if that application is still expected to continue supporting the same divergent business processes.
