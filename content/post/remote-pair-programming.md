During a previous job I spent a lot of time working with delivery teams on other continents, helping them develop software. I was lucky enough to visit them on several occassions for a week at a time, and whilst I was there made lots of progress working with the on-site developers.  Unfortunatley I was not able to stay on-site for the duration of the project and so needed to find other ways of collaborating with the teams remotely from back in the UK.

We started with daily phone calls but we quickly found this to be an awful experience.  Over the phone we struggled to hear what the team members were saying, pick up body language or subtle nuances of the discussion or even pick out who was saying what.  We upgraded to video conferences for the meetings but found, whilst considerably better than the phone, this was still not effective.  We found that, rather ironically, when you are working remotely you need to work even more collaboratively.  For example, we would discuss approaches for the day ahead during the meetings but things would get lost or misinterpreted and following the meeting, people would then go away and diligently write lots of code that was taking us off in different directions.  Communicating over a phone or even a video conference is not nearly as effective as in person.  

We quickly looked to augment the video conferences with more hands-on collaborative working and started investigating tools which might support remote pair programming.
