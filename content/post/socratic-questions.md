In my last [blog post]({{< ref "leadership-styles.md" >}}), I looked at situational leadership and how different influencing styles and techniques might be appropriate in different contexts.  'Push' (directive) influencing techniques are more focused on "telling" whereas 'Pull' (non-directive) techniques tend to involve the use of questions and reflection to guide.  One particular technique involving the use of questions to influence in this way is [Socratic questioning].

[Socratic questioning] is a practice adapted from the [Socratic method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method) to stimulate critical thinking.  It involves systematic questioning to explore ideas and critically analyse logic.  It is frequently used in education, psychological therapy and law schools.  

Socratic questions and the Socratic method can be particularly effective when trying to overcome resistence or resolve differences of opinion.  This is because the technique forces the individual to critically examine the logic of their own argument and is highly effective at highlighting any flaws or inconsistencies in that logic in a non-confrontational way.  This is especially useful when dealing with people suffering from [illusory superiority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority) (the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)) as it helps them identify their own ignorance.  Since Socrates believed the first step to knowledge was recognition of one's own ignorance it follows that his method focuses not so much on proving your point but on disproving the other person's point.

There are essentially 6 types of Socratic questions:

**1. Clarifying thinking and understanding** _e.g. Can you give me an example? Could you explain further?_

**2. Challenging assumptions** _e.g. Is that always the case? Are you assuming X?_

**3. Examining evidence and rationale** _e.g. Why do you say that? How do you know? Why?_

**4. Considering alternative viewpoints and perspectives** _e.g. Are there any alternatives? What is the other side of the argument?_

**5. Considering implications and consequences** _e.g. What would be the implication? Are there any side effects?  What if you are wrong? How can we find out?_

**6. Meta questions** _e.g. Why do you think I asked that question? What does that mean?
