In my last [blog post]({{< ref "leadership-styles.md" >}}), I looked at situational leadership and how different influencing styles and techniques can be effective in different contexts with people at different levels of maturity.  'Push' (directive) influencing techniques are more focused on "telling" whereas 'Pull' (non-directive) techniques tend to involve the use of questions and reflection to guide.  One particular technique involving the use of questions to influence in this way is [Socratic questioning].

[Socratic questioning] is a practice adapted from the [Socratic method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method) to stimulate critical thinking.  It involves systematic questioning to explore ideas, critically analyse logic and consider broader perspectives.  It is frequently used in education and psychological therapy.  

Like other 'Pull' influencing techniques, Socratic questions and the Socratic method can be particularly effective when trying to overcome resistence or resolve differences of opinion.  This is because the technique helps the individual to critically examine the logic of their own argument and is highly effective at highlighting any flaws or inconsistencies in that logic in a non-confrontational way.  This is especially useful when dealing with people suffering from [illusory superiority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority) (the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)) as it can help them consider broader perspectives and identify their own lack of knowledge.  Since Socrates believed the first step to knowledge was recognition of one's own ignorance it follows that his method focuses not so much on proving your point but on helping the other person recognise the flaws in theirs.

There are essentially 6 types of Socratic questions (based upon those proposed by [R. W. Paul]):

#### 1. Clarifying thinking and understanding
Can you give me an example? <br>
Could you explain further? <br>
Are you saying X? <br>
What is the problem you are trying to solve? <br>

#### 2. Challenging assumptions
Is that always the case? <br>
Are you assuming X? <br>
Do you agree that X? <br>
If that is true for one X, is it true for all X? <br>

#### 3. Examining evidence and rationale
Why do you say that? <br>
How do you know? <br>
What data is there to support this?
Why? <br>

#### 4. Considering alternative viewpoints and perspectives
Are there any alternatives? <br>
What is the other side of the argument? <br>
What makes your point of view better? <br>
What would X say about this? <br>
Can you think of any cases where that is not true? <br>

#### 5. Considering implications and consequences
What would be the implication? <br>
Are there any side effects?  <br>
What if you are wrong? <br>
How can we find out? <br>
If this is true, does it mean X is also true? <br>
What else should we be considering? <br>

#### 6. Meta questions
Why do you think I asked that question? <br>
What does that mean? <br>
What else might I ask? <br>
